# 3D-Scan-Simulation

An algorithm to 3D scan objects with an array of cameras rather than LIDAR and measure its performance. My vision for this project was that utilizing photogrammetry and stereoscopic vision, having an array of cameras would be better than LIDAR and provide finer detail. My reasoning for this is that you can implement various stereo techniques across each camera in the grid leading to 36 references in a 3x3 rather than just one with LIDAR.
